project name: More singly linked lists
0. Print list 
function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list using printf and return number of elements on singlelinked lists

 -> declaring a function called "print_listint" that take const h pointer
 -> declare new integer variable to count number of elements started from zero.
 -> declare const pointer and initaize it to const h this help us to make loop 
 -> make while loop inside it print each element and increament the count variable and also iterate over a linked list.
 -> after while loop is done finally return number of elements using count 
1. List length 
a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list

-> declare temp pointer to h
-> declare count and initalize to zero
-> while loop to iterate over a linked list and increament 'count'
-> after loop finshed return count
2. Add node
a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.

-> create new node in funtion and initalize n and next with head pointer
-> make head pointer to point to every new element 
-> then return head address
