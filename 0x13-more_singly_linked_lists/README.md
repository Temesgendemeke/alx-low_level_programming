function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list using printf and return number of elements on singlelinked lists

 -> declaring a function called "print_listint" that take const h pointer
 -> declare new integer variable to count number of elements started from zero.
 -> declare const pointer and initaize it to const h this help us to make loop 
 -> make while loop inside it print each element and increament the count variable and also iterate over a linked list.
 -> after while loop is done finally return number of elements using count
